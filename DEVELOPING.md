### Developing

Contributions are welcome. This repository follows the standard open source protocol and setup with git where there is an abundance of existing resources to get up to speed. Condensed greatly, the workflow is to fork this repository, check out a branch, commit your changes (forming an ideally legible commit history), then submitting a pull request explaining your contribution, ideally referring to the issue you created, or the issue you chose to work on.


### Worfklow

1. Edit code
2. Start a fresh R session with `R --vanilla` and run `devtools::check()` to test your changes. 
   - This also updates builds auto-generated documentation in the directory `man` based on your in-code Markdown. 
   - Syntax errors in that Markdown will be reported as warnings.
   - For example: square brackets must be escaped if meant literally. In Markdown, the unit interval is written \\[0,1\\].
3. Fix any errors or warnings reported by `devtools::check()`. 
   - If you think it is the tests and not the your changes that are in error, update the tests.
   - They're in the `tests/testthat` directory.
4. Commit your changes. 
   - In your commit message, explain what you've changed and why, including any problematic with tests.
   - Include in your commit any changes to the autogenerated documentation in the directory `man` and the file `NAMESPACE`. 
   - It is not necessary to merge changes to these files by hand, as they are autogenerated.

### Online Documentation
- Vignettes for the online documentation are stored in the directory `vignettes`. 
- This online documentation can be rendered locally using `pkgdown::build_site()`. 
- Its layout for this page is defined in `_pkgdown.yml`.
